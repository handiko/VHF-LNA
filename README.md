# VHF-LNA
VHF Low Noise Amplifier Circuit &amp; PCB using common MMIC. This unit is capable upto 1kW at 2m-band and powered by +12V supply thru separate cable (hi-pwer bias tee is not implemented). MMIC input is protected by A BPF, therefore the input NF is only 1dB (approx.). All the Eagle and Gerber files are included.
